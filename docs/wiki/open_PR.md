# Opening Pull-Requests

When opening new pull-requests (PR), please follow the provided template. Add at least 1 coworker as reviewer and don't forget to include in PR description:

- Proposed changes
- Check that you remembered to add the listed functionalities
- Deploy notes (in case something changed in order to deploy the app)
- Additional information that you think are important

Filling this information is important to keep the approved changes history archived, help your coworkers
during code review and help you see if you forgot something before submitting the PR.
